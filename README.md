Notwithstanding the many advantages of Bayesian 14C-analysis,
there exist several statistical procedures that are promising for construction of high-resolution archaeological chronologies.
The application and —all the more— the further development and refinement of such alternative methods
are being currently overlooked in favour of a strong tendency towards Bayesian monopolisation.
Not only is this monopolisation attained at the cost of a reduction in scientific diversity,
but it is actually achieved by disregarding the many known fallacies in favour of the "well known" ones.
