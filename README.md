The result of calibration is an interval on the calibrated time scale for each 14C determination.
Calibrated intervals are usually quite wide, especially in correspondence of plateaus in the calibration curve and can only provide relatively limited information Such an approach results very conservative, but on the other side it leaves the door open for a high degree of interpretation.
This is particularly important because calibration is based exclusiely pm 14C measurements and the calibration curve, whereas stratigraphic, context, and other archaeological features concur to date (or mis date) a target object/event.
Thus, a researcher can use calibrated intervals and data of different nature to formulate more specific hypotheses or elaborate scenarios.
This might be precluded if the scope of calibration is dating precision although Bayesian statistics-based analysis allows to hypothesize difference priors and produce internally-coherent results.

The main difference between a statistics-based approach and the approach proposed here lies in the scope of calibration.
Statistics-based calibration aims to achieve an accurate and precise result and quantify its likelihood, leaving the user to decide whether to accept the result "as is" or reject it.
The methodology illustrated here, instead, simply sets a few boundaries, without quantifying or suggesting likelihood, and lets the user further explore possible options.

We suggest that the two approaches are not mutually exclusive but should instead be paired
in order not only to achieve better information, but also not to lose any information.
